    <p>The Upload module uses a dynamic ingest process to retrieve and transcode video content. When you select a file to upload, {{ site.product_short }} uses a pull-based process to pull the content from a storage location where it then uses the Zencoder transcoding service to transcode the content. </p>
    <p>The Upload module supports various methods of uploading videos:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong> - This method allows you to drag files from your local file system to the Upload module page</li>
      <li><strong>File selection dialog</strong> - This method opens a file selection dialog where you browse and select files to upload</li>
      <li><strong>Remote URL</strong> - This method allows you to enter a URL to specify the location of the source file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This topic will focus on how you can get the remote URL for popular cloud file hosting services. Using the remote URL upload method is helpful for larger files that may have been edited/processed by people outside of your organization. Rather than copying a large file to your local machine, a remote URL to the file can be provided and {{ site.product_short }} can pull the file from the location. In all cases, you must ensure the URL to the file is publicly available or the upload will fail.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Before uploading videos, make sure the appropriate ingest profile has been selected.</aside>

    <p>To get the URL for a video stored out on Google Drive, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to your Google Drive account.</li>
      <li>Locate the video you want to upload and right-click on it.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Get Shareable link</strong>.</li>
      <li>For the permissions, make sure you select the option so that <strong>Anyone with the link</strong> can access the file. If the permission is set to <strong>Restricted</strong>, the upload will fail.

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you have a corporate Google account, your only sharing options may be restricted or sharing to your domain. If you don't have the ability to share the file to <strong>Anyone with the link</strong>, {{ site.product_short }} will not be able to access the file and the upload will fail.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Copy link</strong>. Unfortunately, this doesn't generate a direct link to the video file. We can use another site to generate a direct link to the video file from the sharing link.</li>
      <li>Navigate to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/home">https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/home</a>. Other sites are also available than will generate a direct link to Google Drive files.</li>
      <li>Paste in your sharing URL.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Create Direct Link</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The URL returned in the Output link field is the URL to use in the Upload module to upload the video.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You can not use a YouTube URL because a direct links to video files aren't generated.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Uploads will not work if a size warning for Google Drive is displayed (typically for files &gt; 100MB). Even after modifying the URL, it will redirect to a size error page and the upload will fail.</aside>

      <li>The URL to the file may end with <code translate="No">?dl=0</code>. To force the browser to download the contents of the link, you must change that part of the URL to <code translate="No">?dl=1</code>.</li>

    <p>There should be no issues using URLs for video files hosted on other cloud platforms (i.e. Amazon S3) as long as the URL is a<strong> public facing URL</strong>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: When ingesting video files from Amazon S3, it is possible to create a bucket policy so videos that are not available to everyone can be accessed from {{ site.product_short }}.
